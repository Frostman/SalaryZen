SalaraZenAggregator
===================

Extremely simple python script that fetches different sources (currently only one) and aggregates them to the single data.json with a number of currency rates from different banks.

Example crontab: */5 * * * * /opt/SalaryZen/SalaryZenAggregator/aggregate-wrapper.sh
